Python is an incredibly powerful language, and with its easy readability and useful packages, it's no wonder that it's one of the most popular coding languages. I found
Python to be a great language to implement my ideas for various problems.

## [MorseCode](https://github.com/kevinfengcs88/python-projects/blob/main/MorseCode.py),[Morse](https://github.com/kevinfengcs88/python-projects/blob/main/Morse.py), and [AdvancedMorseCode](https://github.com/kevinfengcs88/python-projects/blob/main/AdvancedMorseCode.py)
The above projects were all created when I first learned Morse code, mainly utilizing the mnemonics that Michael "Vsauce" Stevens teaches in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY_OIwideLg).
I created my own translator for Morse code, which can both translate Morse code to English letters and English letters to Morse code. It interprets '.' characters as
short signals or "dits," and interprets '-' characters as long signals or "dahs." Both MorseCode and Morse ask the user whether they would like to encrypt English letters 
into Morse code or decrypt Morse code into English letters, with Morse more stably exiting from the command prompt window that an .exe file opens. AdvancedMorseCode does not
require the user to specify "encrypt" or "decrypt," and simply translates according to the input appropriately.
